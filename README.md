# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). They are neither meticulously tested nor polished, they were just working well enough for the purpose of the event. Some provide only part of the answer, and a bit of manual labor was required for the solution.
